## Infrastructure Security

The identity platform runs on a dedicated Hetzner server that is isolated from other Hack Club infrastructure. Server access is restricted to two individuals (Nora and Zach), both of whom use physical second-factor authentication tokens.

All production console access is [logged](https://github.com/basecamp/console1984) and [audited](https://github.com/basecamp/audits1984/).

Identity documents are encrypted at rest with a unique AES-256-GCM key per file via [SSE-C](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html) in Cloudflare R2 storage.
