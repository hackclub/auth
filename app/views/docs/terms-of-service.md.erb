We should probably have a lot of flowery legal language here. 

In the meantime, here's something to tide you over:

## Acceptable use

- Don't attempt to access anyone else's account.
- Don't attempt to disrupt or disable the service.
- Follow the rules laid out in Hack Club's [Code of Conduct](https://hackclub.com/conduct/).
- For security testing, please use the [staging environment](https://hca.dinosaurbbq.org), or at least limit testing to accounts you own.

## Account termination

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms or are found to be fraudulent.
