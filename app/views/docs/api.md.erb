The Hack Club Account API allows you to retrieve user identity information after they've authorized your app via OAuth.

You may want to read the <%= link_to "OAuth Guide", doc_path("oauth-guide") %> first to get access tokens.

### Authentication

<div class="banner info">
Most API endpoints require an OAuth access token. Include it in the <code>Authorization</code> header:

<pre>Authorization: Bearer idntk.mraowj2z72e1x8i2a60o88j3h7d0f1</pre>
</div>

### Base URL

```
<%= root_url.chomp("/") %>
```

## Endpoints

### GET /api/v1/me

Get the authenticated user's identity information based on granted scopes.

<%= render Components::APIExample.new(method: "GET", url: api_v1_me_url, path_only: true) %>

**Authentication:** Required

**Response:**

<pre><code class="language-json"><%
  identity = stub_identity_with_address(FactoryBot.build_stubbed(:identity))
  scopes = ["email", "name", "verification_status", "slack_id", "basic_info", "address", "legal_name"]
%><%= render_api_example(template: "api/v1/identities/me", identity: identity, scopes: scopes, color_by_scope: true).html_safe %></code></pre>

**Verification status values:**
- `needs_submission` - User hasn't started verification
- `pending` - Verification is being reviewed
- `verified` - Successfully verified
- `ineligible` - Verification was rejected

### GET /api/external/check

Check the verification status of a user by their ID, email, or Slack ID. This is a public endpoint that doesn't require authentication.

<%= render Components::APIExample.new(method: "GET", url: api_external_check_url(email: "orpheus@hackclub.com"), path_only: true) %>

**Authentication:** Not required

**Parameters (provide one):**
- `idv_id` - User's public ID (format: `ident!xxxxx`)
- `email` - User's email address
- `slack_id` - User's Slack ID

**Response:**

```json
{
  "result": "verified_eligible"
}
```

**Possible result values:**
- `needs_submission` - User hasn't started verification
- `pending` - Verification is being reviewed
- `verified_eligible` - Verified and eligible for YSWS (under 18)
- `verified_but_over_18` - Verified but over 18
- `rejected` - Verification was rejected
- `not_found` - No user found with the provided identifier

## Available Scopes

When requesting OAuth authorization, you can request the following scopes:

| Scope | Description | Community Access    |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| `email` | Access to email address | ✅                   |
| `name` | Access to first and last name | ✅                   |
| `slack_id` | Access to Slack ID | ✅                   |
| `verification_status` | Verification status and YSWS eligibility | ✅                   |
| `basic_info` | Email, name, verification status, birthday, phone | HQ only             |
| `legal_name` | Legal first and last name | HQ only             |
| `address` | Mailing addresses | HQ only             |
| `set_slack_id` | Ability to associate Slack IDs | HQ only, deprecated |
## Error Responses

<div class="banner info">
All API endpoints return standard HTTP status codes:
<ul>
<li><code>200</code> - Success</li>
<li><code>401</code> - Unauthorized (missing or invalid token)</li>
<li><code>403</code> - Forbidden (insufficient permissions/scopes)</li>
<li><code>404</code> - Not found</li>
<li><code>422</code> - Invalid parameters</li>
</ul>

Error responses include a JSON body with details:

<pre>{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Invalid or expired token"
}</pre>
</div>

## Program-wide endpoints

<div class="banner info">
<b>About program keys:</b>
<p>
In addition to user OAuth tokens, HQ official programs can use a program key for machine-to-machine API calls. Program keys start with <code>prgmk.</code> and can be used in the Authorization header:

<pre>Authorization: Bearer prgmk.abc123def456...</pre>

Program keys have access to all identities that have authorized your application, not just a single user. Avoid using them. Protect them with your life. <br/>
If you think you need a <code>prgmk</code>, think harder about it. You probably don't.
</p>
</div>

<div class="banner warning">
<b>HQ official programs only: </b>
<p>
These endpoints are only available when using a program key.<br/>
</p>
</div>

### GET /api/v1/identities/:id

Get a specific user's identity by their public ID.

<%= render Components::APIExample.new(method: "GET", url: api_v1_identity_url(id: "ident!abc123"), path_only: true) %>

**Authentication:** Program key required

**Parameters:**
- `id` (path) - The user's public ID (e.g., `ident!abc123`)

**Response:**

```json
<%
  identity = FactoryBot.build_stubbed(:identity, last_name: "Hacksworth")
%><%= render_api_example(template: "api/v1/identities/show", identity: identity) %>
```

Fields returned depend on your program's configured scopes.

### GET /api/v1/identities

List all identities that have authorized your application.

<%= render Components::APIExample.new(method: "GET", url: api_v1_identities_url, path_only: true) %>

**Authentication:** Program key required

**Response:**

```json
<%
  identities = [
    FactoryBot.build_stubbed(:identity, first_name: "Heidi", last_name: "Latta"),
    FactoryBot.build_stubbed(:identity, last_name: "Wofford")
  ]
%><%= render_api_example(template: "api/v1/identities/index", identities: identities) %>
```
